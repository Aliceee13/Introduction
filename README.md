# Introduction
This repositorie introduces the research field of remote sensing that I am good at:

1. Inversion of remote sensing land surface temperature data.
Landsat satellite data, MODIS satellite data, ASTER satellite data and ECOSTRESS satellite data.

2. Downscaling of remote sensing land surface temperature
Sentinel-3 LST land surface temperature downscaling, MODIS LST land surface temperature downscaling.

3. Processing and application of night lighting remote sensing data.
Processing and application of DMSP-OLS data, NPP-VIIRS(NOAA-VIIRS) data, Luojia-1 data and Black Marble data.

4. Extraction of urban impervious surface by remote sensing

If you are interested in my research field, or want to get relevant algorithms, data and papers from me for free, please give me a comment or contact me. I will be glad to help you. Thank you!
